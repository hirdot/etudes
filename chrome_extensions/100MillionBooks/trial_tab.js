It is a great many years since I saw Richer, the famous rope-dancer, perform at Sadler's Wells. He was matchless in his art, and added to his extraordinary skill exquisite ease, and unaffected natural grace. I was at that time employed in copying a half-length picture of Sir Joshua Reynolds's; and it put me out of conceit with it. How ill this part was made out in the drawing! How heavy, how slovenly this other was painted! I could not help saying to myself, 'If the rope- dancer had performed his task in this manner, leaving so many gaps and botches in his work, he would have broke his neck long ago; I should never have seen that vigorous elasticity of nerve and precision of movement!' \u2014 Is it then so easy an undertaking (comparatively) to dance on a tightrope? Let any one, who thinks so, get up and try. There is the thing. It is that which at first we cannot do at all, which in the end is done to such perfection. To account for this in some degree, I might observe that mechanical dexterity is confined to doing some one particular thing, which you can repeat as often as you please, in which you know whether you succeed or fail, and where the point of perfection consists in succeeding in a given undertaking. \u2014 <span class='highlight'>In mechanical efforts, you improve by perpetual practice, and you do so infallibly, because the object to be attained is not a matter of taste or fancy or opinion, but of actual experiment, in which you must either do the thing or not do it.<\/span> If a man is put to aim at a mark with a bow and arrow, he must hit it or miss it, that's certain. He cannot deceive himself, and go on shooting wide or falling short, and still fancy that he is making progress. The distinction between right and wrong, between true and false, is here palpable; and he must either correct his aim or persevere in his error with his eyes open, for which there is neither excuse nor temptation. If a man is learning to dance on a rope, if he does not mind what he is about, he will break his neck. After that, it will be in vain for him to argue that he did not make a false step. His situation is not like that of Goldsmith's pedagogue.\u2014 <blockquote>'In argument they own'd his wondrous skill,<br>And e'en though vanquish'd, he could argue still.' <\/blockquote> Danger is a good teacher, and makes apt scholars. So are disgrace, defeat, exposure to immediate scorn and laughter. There is no opportunity in such cases for self-delusion, no idling time away, no being off your guard (or you must take the consequences) \u2014 neither is there any room for humour or caprice or prejudice. If the Indian Juggler were to play tricks in throwing up the three case-knives, which keep their positions like the leaves of a crocus in the air, he would cut his fingers. <span class='highlight'>I can make a very bad antithesis without cutting my fingers.<\/span> The tact of style is more ambiguous than that of double-edged instruments. If the Juggler were told that by flinging himself under the wheels of the Jaggernaut, when the idol issues forth on a gaudy day, he would immediately be transported into Paradise, he might believe it, and nobody could disprove it. So the Brahmins may say what they please on that subject, may build up dogmas and mysteries without end, and not be detected: but their ingenious countryman cannot persuade the frequenters of the Olympic Theatre that he performs a number of astonishing feats without actually giving proofs of what he says. \u2014 There is then in this sort of manual dexterity, first a gradual aptitude acquired to a given exertion of muscular power, from constant repetition, and in the next place, an exact knowledge how much is still wanting and necessary to be supplied. The obvious test is to increase the effort or nicety of the operation, and still to find it come true. The muscles ply instinctively to the dictates of habit. Certain movements and impressions of the hand and eye, having been repeated together an infinite number of times, are unconsciously but unavoidably cemented into closer and closer union; the limbs require little more than to be put in motion for them to follow a regular track with ease and certainty; so that the mere intention of the will acts mathematically, like touching the spring of a machine, and you come with Locksley in Ivanhoe, in shooting at a mark, 'to allow for the wind.

Adopting it is usually a pretty safe strategy politically in the United States, for most everyone likes to look to new technology for solutions to current problems. Championing a new technology is often the path of least risk and hostility. <br><br> On the other hand, challenging new technology can be a highly risky enterprise. Claiming that a new technology is inherently negative is usually also an announcement that one is willing to accept marginal status in society. That is, one is willing to risk being classified as anti-technology, anti-progress, neo-Luddite, and, hence, anti-American in order to protest the technology. Even the related, and more frequently used, strategy of pointing out negative impacts without making a judgment about the technology as a whole is dangerous.

Consider evolutionary images of 'man the tool-maker,' e.g., the primate in the movie 2001 who transformed a bone into a weapon to the resounding crescendo of drums and trumpets. If humans abuse technology, certainly blame the people, but do not condemn the technology, which is simply a nonhuman object. Furthermore, public debates over technologies do indeed regularly display a range of policy positions regarding their impacts. Middle ground is a more frequent outcome than one might think, for people always search for ways of using new technologies wisely. <\/p>\"","tags":"","title":"The Machine in Me: An Anthropologist Sits Among Computer Engineers","uid":"cdwZUDzd8Wfx1AeoO","trial_book": true, "_id":"326919","year":"1998"},

As Dr. Kent Kiehl shows, psychopaths can be identified by a checklist of symptoms that includes pathological lying; lack of empathy, guilt, and remorse; grandiose sense of self-worth; manipulation; and failure to accept one's actions. But why do psychopaths behave the way they do? Is it the result of their environment\u2014 how they were raised\u2014or is there a genetic compo\u00adnent to their lack of conscience? <br><br> This is the question Kiehl, a prot\u00e9g\u00e9 of famed psychopath researcher Dr. Robert Hare, was deter\u00admined to answer as he began his career twenty years ago. To aid in his quest to unravel the psy\u00adchopathic mind, Kiehl created the first mobile functional MRI scanner to study psychopaths in prison populations. The brains of more than five hundred psychopaths and three thousand other offenders have been scanned by Kiehl's labora\u00adtory\u2014the world's largest forensic neuroscience repository of its kind. Over the course of <i>The Psy\u00adchopath Whisperer<\/i>, we follow the scientific bread crumbs that Kiehl uncovered to show that the key brain structures that correspond with emotional engagement and reactions are diminished in psy\u00adchopaths, offering new clues to how to predict and treat the disorder. <br><br> In <i>The Psychopath Whisperer<\/i>, Kiehl describes in fascinating detail his years working with psy\u00adchopaths and studying their thought processes\u2014 from the remorseless serial killers he meets with behind bars to children whose behavior and per\u00adsonality traits exhibit the early warning signs of psychopathy. <br><br> Less than 1 percent of the general population meets the criteria for psychopathy. But psycho\u00adpaths account for a vastly outsized proportion of violent crimes. And as Kiehl shows, many who aren't psychopaths exhibit some of the behaviors and traits associated with the condition. What do you do if you discover your roommate, or boss, or the person you are dating has traits that define a psy\u00adchopath? And what does having a diminished limbic region of the brain mean for how the legal system approaches crimes committed by psychopaths? <br><br> A compelling narrative of cutting-edge science, <i>The Psychopath Whisperer <\/i>will open your eyes on a fascinating but little understood world, with startling implications for society, the law, and our personal lives.","is_fiction":"0","isbn10":"077043584X","isbn13":"9780770435844","live":"1","suggested_by_link":"","suggested_by_name":"","supersnip_text":"\"<p class='visual-quote'>\"I've done shit you can't even imagine.

He was only in his late twenties when I interviewed him, but he had a rap sheet like no one I had ever interviewed before. As a teenager he had committed burglary, armed robbery of banks and convenience stores, arson for hire, and all kinds of drug-related crimes from distribution to forcing others to mule drugs for him. He would force women to hide plastic baggies of cocaine in their body cavities and transport them across borders and state lines and on plane flights. One of Richie's girls got a baggie stuck in her vagina. Richie used a knife to \"open her up a bit\" so he could retrieve his drugs. He said he didn't use her again after that. When I asked him what he meant by that, he said that he didn't use her for sex; she was too loose now, and she lost her nerve about carrying drugs. <br><br> Richie smiled as he told me a story of a prostitute he had killed for pissing him off. He actually seemed proud when he described wrapping her up in the same blanket he had suffocated her with so he could keep all the forensic evidence in one place. He put her in the trunk of his car and drove out to a deserted stretch of road bordered by a deep forest.

The cop didn't search me when I got out of the car, and I was carrying a knife and a handgun. I'm surprised that I passed that field test since I had had a few drinks that night. I was planning to beat the cop senseless and then I was going to put the girl's body in the backseat of the cop's car.

Assume that a person's strength is measured in some sort of units. An opponent's strength is ten, yours is seven. If your opponent pushes you with all his might, you won't be able remain standing, even if you resist with all your might. You'll either fall or step back. This is opposing strength with strength.

Let's illustrate this tenet with the following example. Imagine you are a door and that you are locked shut; your opponent, however, is determined to break you open with his shoulder. If your opponent is big and strong enough and rams through the door (that is, you) from a running start, he will achieve his aim. Now let's consider a different turn of events. Instead of digging in your heels and resisting your opponent's onslaught, you time it so that when your opponent is just about to hit the door, you unlatch it. Then, not meeting any resistance and unable to stop, your opponent bursts through the wide open door, losing balance and falling. If at this time you raise the threshold slightly, \"stick out your heel,\" so that he trips (if we're going to fantasize, let's do it right), then victory will be unconditional. Minimum effort, maximum effect. <br><br> Similarly, you can play with the lock when the door opens outward and your opponent pulls the door (that is, you) open. As soon as your opponent tries to jerk the handle, thinking he is going to break down the locked door, the lock is opened and he is sure to lose balance. If at this time we are able to take the handle off the door, as it were, then that person, who was counting on brute strength but met no resistance while groping with the void, will surely fall on his back. <\/p>\"","tags":"Sports,Health","title":"Judo: History, Theory, Practice","uid":"8W1zBGErtwvZKtJH7","trial_book": true, "_id":"326746","year":"2004"},
